# Default Credit Card Prediction Project

The Default Credit Card Prediction Project offers a solution to the challenge of assessing credit risk for financial institutions.

Utilizing historical credit card customer data and machine learning algorithms, the project aims to develop predictive models with specific goals:
- Enhance consistency: By automating the credit assessment process and providing objective scores.
- Identify risk patterns: By analyzing historical data to uncover factors associated with credit defaults.

Through these efforts, the project seeks to improve the accuracy and consistency of credit risk assessment while identifying early warning signs of potential defaults, leading to reduced risk of defaults and financial losses, as well as improved customer experience through personalized credit offers and early intervention.
